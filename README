#USERve

This is a implementaion of the Uflex user class. I did this implementaion as a project to better understand PHP  during my week long vacations. I would not suggest using this for any actual projects, but would be great to learn PHP devolopment. The template implemention is a little messed up, I had a  templating feature in mind(like in wordpress) but sadly it ended up this way. If you need a good user managment script you can look into usercake (http://usercake.com)
##Install instructions
 * Go to models/settings.php fill in the details of the databasename,username,password etc.
 * click on install or if that does not work for you, you can manuall copy and execute sql.txt
